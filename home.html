      <h1>AB-Testing</h1>
      <p class = "text">
        For this project, I took two different versions of a cactus-shopping website, and performed A/B Testing and statistical analysis to 
        gather insight into the difference between the two UI designs. 
      </p>

    <h2>Part 0: Making the Websites</h2>

    <p class = "text"> 
      I was given a version of the cactus making website, and asked to make modifications to it to create a second version.
      I decided to make the shopping cart logo next to "CART" at the bottom of the screen the same color as the rest of the buttons on the screen,
      instead of the original red. This simple modification is shown below:

    </p>

    <div class="row text-center justify-content-center">
      <div class="col mb-5">
          <h5>Version A (Original)</h5>
          <img class="ab_versions" src="v1.png">
            
      </div>
      <div class="col mb-5">
          <h5>Version B (Modified)</h5>
          <img class="ab_versions" src="v2.png">
            
      </div>
      
    </div>

    <h2>Part 1: Creating Hypotheses</h2>

    <p class = "text"> 
      Users were assigned the task of adding $150 dollars worth of cacti into their cart. 
      For this project, I measured two variables: Time to Completion and Return Rate. Time of Completion refers to
      the time it takes for the user to complete the task. The Return Rate refers to rate at which users decide to return to the original 
      page. The following table shows my Null and Alternative Hypotheses for each task, as well as my reasoning for each.



    </p>

    <table class="table table-hover table-text">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Variable</th>
            <th scope="col">Null Hypothesis</th>
            <th scope="col">Alternative Hypothesis</th>
            <th scope="col">Reasoning</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Time to Completion</th>
            <td>Version B and Version A have the same Time to Completion</td>
            <td>Version B has a longer Time to Completion than Version A
            </td>
            <td>Since Version B's cart icon has the same color as the rest of the buttons on the page, the user could confuse the two 
              elements, and take longer to figure out where to view the contents of the cart. 
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Return Rate</th>
            <td>Version A and Version B have the same Return Rate</td>
            <td>Version B has a lower Return Rate than Version A</td>
            <td>The cart icon's color makes viewing the contents of the cart harder for the user, since they may not be 
              able to find the cart. This could cause B to to have a lower Return Rate since users may not leave the first page in the first place.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Part 2: Data Collection</h2>

      <p class = "text">
        I deployed a website that would show Version A of the website half the time, and Version B otherwise. Other students in my class
        were asked to complete the task descirbed above (add $150 worth of cacti into the cart), and their interactions with the website were recorded. 
        I was able to collect data from 20 users. The following are cleaned-up tables of the data I collected. 
      </p>
      <div class="row text-center justify-content-center">
          <div class="col mb-5">
              <h5>Time to Completion Table</h5>
              <img src="TC.png">
                
          </div>
          <div class="col mb-5">
              <h5>Return Rate Table</h5>
              <img class="rr" src="RR.png">
                
          </div>
          
        </div>

      <h2>Part 3: Conclusions and Takeaways</h2>

      <p class = "text">
        Here is an infographic depicting my conclusions:
      </p>
      <br>

      <div class="row text-center justify-content-center">
          <div class="col mb-5">
          <img class = "inf" src="infographic.png">
        </div>

      </div>

      <p class = "text">
        And as for my final takeaways:
      </p>

      <ul class = "list">
          <li class = "bullet">20 samples is nowhere near enough for AB testing. My p-values were way off, and a lot of it was due to the high standard deviations.
            Collecting more samples may help with this problem.
          </li>
          <li class = "bullet">I attempted altering a simple hierarchy/consistency rule by changing the color of an icon to be the exact same as a button.
            With 20 samples, it doesn't seem like I can make any conclusion about this having a significant impact on navigation through a simple website. Perhaps this change applied
            on a larger scale could create more of a difference.
          </li>
          <li class = "bullet">There's something that didn't feel right about data collection either. Since everyone was at their own home/working space during section,
            there was no way of controlling the conditions where the users were operating from. Perhaps a much larger sample size could alleviate this problem, but this could
            be one of the reasons why there was such a high standard deviation.
          </li>
      </ul>
